#Sales Analysis Dashboard using  Power BI & SQL

## üìä Project Overview
This project leverages **SQL queries** for comprehensive sales analysis and visualizes insights using **Power BI dashboards**. It focuses on evaluating performance across **categories, sub-categories, payment methods, cities, states, and customer segments**.

The project is structured into five key sections:
1. Category Analysis
2. Sub-Category Analysis
3. Payment Mode Analysis
4. City & State Analysis
5. Joined/Combined Analysis (Profit, Sales, Customers)

## üìÇ Dataset Description
- **Orders Table:** Order ID, Customer Name, City, State, Order Date
- **Details Table:** Order ID, Category, Sub-Category, Quantity, Amount, Profit, Payment Mode

Tables are linked using `Order ID` for combined analysis.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools Used
- **SQL** ‚Äì Data extraction and aggregation
- **Power BI** ‚Äì Data visualization and reporting
- **GitHub** ‚Äì Version control and documentation

## üîé Part 1: Category Analysis
### SQL Queries
```sql
-- Calculate Total Sales Amount by Category
SELECT Category, SUM(Amount) AS Total_Amount
FROM details
GROUP BY Category;

-- Calculate Total Quantity Sold by Category
SELECT Category, SUM(Quantity) AS Total_Quantity
FROM details
GROUP BY Category;

-- Calculate Total Profit by Category
SELECT Category, SUM(Profit) AS Total_Profit
FROM details
GROUP BY Category;

-- Count Total Orders by Category
SELECT Category, COUNT(DISTINCT [Order ID]) AS Total_Orders
FROM details
GROUP BY Category;
```

```sql
-- List all unique Sub-Categories
SELECT DISTINCT Sub-Category FROM details;

-- Count total Sub-Categories
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Sub-Category) AS total_sub_category FROM details;

-- Top 5 Sub-Categories by Quantity Sold
SELECT Sub-Category, SUM(Quantity) AS Total_Quantity
FROM details
GROUP BY Sub-Category
ORDER BY SUM(Quantity) DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Top 5 Sub-Categories by Sales Amount
SELECT Sub-Category, SUM(Amount) AS Total_Amount
FROM details
GROUP BY Sub-Category
ORDER BY SUM(Amount) DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Top 5 Sub-Categories by Profit
SELECT Sub-Category, SUM(Profit) AS Total_Profit
FROM details
GROUP BY Sub-Category
ORDER BY SUM(Profit) DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

## üîé Part 3: Payment Mode Analysis
### SQL Queries
```sql
-- List all payment modes
SELECT DISTINCT PaymentMode FROM details;

-- Count distinct payment modes
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT PaymentMode) AS distinct_paymentmode FROM details;

-- Total Quantity Sold per Payment Mode
SELECT PaymentMode, SUM(Quantity) AS Total_Quantity
FROM details
GROUP BY PaymentMode;

-- Total Transactions per Payment Mode
SELECT PaymentMode, COUNT(*) AS Total_Transactions
FROM details
GROUP BY PaymentMode
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

-- Category-wise Payment Mode Distribution
SELECT Category, PaymentMode, COUNT(*) AS Transactions
FROM details
GROUP BY Category, PaymentMode
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

-- Top 2 Sub-Categories per Category by Sales Amount
SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT Category, Sub-Category, SUM(Amount) AS Total_Amount,
         DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Category ORDER BY SUM(Amount) DESC) AS Rank
  FROM details
  GROUP BY Category, Sub-Category
) t
WHERE Rank <= 2;
```
